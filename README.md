# demosplan Addon Installer

This is a Composer plugin used by demosplan-core to
simplify the installation of Addons.

### How to use/test?

- This needs to be added as a dependency to all future demosplan-addons in their composer.jsons like this (change version depending):
 ```
 "require": {
          "demos-europe/demosplan-addon-installer": "<latest-stable-version>"
        }
 ```
